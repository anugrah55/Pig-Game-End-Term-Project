🎲 Carrot Dice Game

A turn-based dice game for 2 to 4 players where players must balance risk and strategy. Roll the dice to earn carrots, but be careful — one bad roll can wipe everything!

🕹️ How the Game Works
	•	The game supports 2, 3, or 4 players.
	•	Players take turns rolling a dice.
	•	If the dice roll is any number other than 0, the player earns that many carrots.
	•	If the dice roll is 0, all unbanked carrots are lost for that turn.
	•	At any point during their turn, a player can bank their carrots.
	•	Banked carrots are safe and stored permanently.
	•	Once banked, the turn ends.
	•	The turn then passes to the next player.

🏆 Winning Condition
